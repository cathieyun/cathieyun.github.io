[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un7-pwkZRDc&feature=youtu.be&t=4632) and [Slides](https://speakerdeck.com/cathieyun/how-bulletproofs-works)

I talk about how the math behind the [Bulletproofs paper](https://crypto.stanford.edu/bulletproofs/) works, going through the inner product proof and showing how a range proof can be constructed. 

The video is from the Monero Village livestream, and is missing the slides from the end of the talk. I will upload a link of a better video when they post edited videos.
