[Video](https://cryptovillage.org/implementing-a-zero-knowledge-proof-or-how-to-write-bulletproofs-in-rust/). Zero knowledge proofs are powerful tools; come learn about how they work and what they enable! We’ll get down and dirty in the details of Bulletproofs, a zero knowledge proof protocol that doesn’t require trusted setup. I’ll walk you through the math/crypto of Bulletproofs, alongside my open-source implementation in Rust. You’ll walk away with an appreciation for zero knowledge proofs, a deeper understanding of Bulletproofs, and hopefully some interest in tinkering on or building systems with zero knowledge proof protocols yourself!
