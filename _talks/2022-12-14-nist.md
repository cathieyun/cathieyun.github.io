I presented on Google's work toward real-world deployment of FHE, at the [NIST Crypto Reading Club](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/crypto-reading-club). [Slides here](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/Presentations/2022/crclub-2022-12-14/images-media/20221214-crypto-club-cathie-yun-slides-real-FHE.pdf), recording will be posted once it is uploaded.

Abstract: FHE is a cryptographic primitive slowly reaching the realms of reality.  This talk provides an engineerâ€™s perspective on deploying large scale systems with FHE, its practical challenges, and open problems. The talk highlights the importance of compilers in realizing FHE as a privacy tool. It also includes a deeper dive into the FHE transpiler open sourced by Google, its modular architecture, and how it can accelerate FHE research and software development.
