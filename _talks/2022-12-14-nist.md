I presented on Google's work toward real-world deployment of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), at the [NIST Crypto Reading Club](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/crypto-reading-club). This talk provides an engineerâ€™s perspective on deploying large scale systems with FHE, its practical challenges, and open problems. The talk highlights the importance of compilers in realizing FHE as a privacy tool. It also includes a deeper dive into the FHE transpiler open sourced by Google, its modular architecture, and how it can accelerate FHE research and software development.
