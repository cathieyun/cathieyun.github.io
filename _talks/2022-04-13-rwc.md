[Video](https://youtu.be/bpS3-yTSxJI). I sat on an "Ask Me Anything" panel at Real World Crypto 2022 to talk about the relationship between cryptography research and its use in industry, give advice to folks starting out their cryptography career, and to defend the usefulness of blockchains (at least, as a way to fund really cool cryptography research).
