I'm interested in bridging the gap between research and applied cryptography. In practice, that means designing, reviewing, and implementing privacy-preserving cryptographic protocols. I'm currently at Google, working on making Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) practical for real-world use. We are trying to do this through a general-purpose [FHE Transpiler](https://github.com/google/fully-homomorphic-encryption), as well as through cryptographic and hardware improvements. 

I used to work on Google's cryptography security team, doing protocol/code reviews and penetration testing for products. These include [Google/Apple's Exposure Notifications](https://www.google.com/covid19/exposurenotifications/), anonymous token protocols ([Trust Tokens](https://developer.chrome.com/en/docs/privacy-sandbox/trust-tokens/) for Chrome, and [blind signature based tokens](https://one.google.com/about/vpn/howitworks) for Google One's VPN), and the [Private Information Retrieval (PIR)](https://github.com/google/private-retrieval) service.

Previously, I have implemented zero knowledge proofs ([Bulletproofs](https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/bulletproofs)) and have worked on [multiparty computation for private queries](https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi17/technical-sessions/presentation/wang-frank). I'm co-organizing the 2023 [High Assurance Cryptography Software (HACS) Workshop](https://www.hacs-workshop.org/) in Tokyo. For a more complete account of my work, you can download my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18vCCvLKReWIIxztbq22PqBvfvgV2oZS3/view).

In my spare time, I enjoy [rock climbing](https://www.mountainproject.com/user/110471998/cathie-yun). I am also known to occasionally dabble in circus arts ([acroyoga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LI6vLPBI0nQ&t=285s) and aerial silks), skiing, and trail running. My brother [Maxwell](https://blog.maxwelly.com/) does cool stuff too.
