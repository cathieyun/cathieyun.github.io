I'm interested in bridging the gap between research and applied cryptography. In practice, that means designing, reviewing, and implementing privacy-preserving cryptographic protocols. These include Zero-Knowledge Proofs (Bulletproofs), Private Information Retrieval (PIR), and Anonymous Tokens (Trust Tokens and Blind Signatures). I'm currently at Google, working on making Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) practical.
