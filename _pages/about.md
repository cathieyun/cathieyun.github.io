I'm interested in bridging the gap between research and applied cryptography. I'm currently a cryptography engineer at Apple, working on libraries such as corecrypto and CryptoKit, and bringing my cryptographic expertise to Apple features and products.

Previously I was at Google, working on making Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) practical. I implemented [Jaxite](https://github.com/google/jaxite), a TFHE library written in JAX to target TPU and GPUs, and worked on a general-purpose [FHE Transpiler](https://github.com/google/fully-homomorphic-encryption). I was also on Google's security team, doing cryptography protocol design, security reviews, and red teaming. 

I enjoy working on zero knowledge proofs - I coauthored the fastest [Bulletproofs implementation](https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/bulletproofs) ever, and have done research on input validation for Secure Aggregation using zero knowledge proofs ([ACORN](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1461)).

I did my undergrad and master's at MIT. My master's research was on [multiparty computation for private queries](https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi17/technical-sessions/presentation/wang-frank), and was supervised by Matei Zaharia and Vinod Vaikuntanathan with the CSAIL Parallel and Distributed Operating Systems (PDOS) lab. 

I am an organizer for the [High Assurance Cryptography Software (HACS) Workshop](https://www.hacs-workshop.org/). For a more complete account of my work, you can download my CV [here](http://cathieyun.github.io/files/cathie-yun-resume.pdf).

In my spare time, I enjoy [rock climbing](https://www.mountainproject.com/user/110471998/cathie-yun), skiing, and circus arts ([acroyoga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LI6vLPBI0nQ&t=285s) and aerial silks). I occasionally [write](https://cathieyun.medium.com/) about my escapades. My brother [Maxwell](https://blog.maxwelly.com/) does cool stuff too.
