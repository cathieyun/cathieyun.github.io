I'm interested in bridging the gap between research and applied cryptography. In practice, that means designing, reviewing, and implementing privacy-preserving cryptographic protocols. These include zero-knowledge proofs (Bulletproofs), Private Information Retrieval (PIR) schemes, VOPRF based anonymous token protocols (Trust Tokens, used in Chrome), and Google/Apple's Exposure Notifications API.
